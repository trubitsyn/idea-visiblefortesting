# VisibleForTesting [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/trubitsyn/VisibleForTesting.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/trubitsyn/VisibleForTesting) [![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/jetbrains/plugin/d/9952-visiblefortesting.svg)](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9952-visiblefortesting)

@VisibleForTesting annotation support for the IntelliJ platform.

# Motivation

It's time-consuming to annotate existing non-public methods: you have to remove modifiers and manually type the annotation.

Now you don't have to: plugin will do that for you.

# Supported annotation types

* [android.support.annotation.VisibleForTesting](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/annotation/VisibleForTesting.html)
* [com.google.common.annotations.VisibleForTesting](https://google.github.io/guava/releases/19.0/api/docs/com/google/common/annotations/VisibleForTesting.html)

# Prerequisites

The desired annotation type must be accessible in order for intention actions to be shown.

## android.support.annotation

Annotation elements are available since Support Library `25.0.0` and won't be generated by the plugin when using older versions.

# Features

Supported programming languages: Java, Kotlin. Please note: Java methods cannot be annotated from Kotlin and vice-versa yet.

## Choose from multiple annotation types to import
